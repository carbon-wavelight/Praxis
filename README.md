# Praxis
Praxis is a to-do list desktop application made entirely in Rust, using the Druid UI toolkit.

For now this is just a fun project exploring the possibilities of front-end UI in Rust.
I give credit for the initial codebase to Techno3d. I followed their tutorial here [https://youtu.be/YEa2eq4HEU8].

There are plans to turn this into a fully-fledged day organizer for ADHD folks.

Planned Features:
- Daily Goals section
- Weekly Goals section
- Task Splitter (break down tasks into smaller steps)
- tab or slide-out extension window for weekly planner.

Enjoy!
